# Personal Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio project! This project serves as a creative exploration of what can be accomplished using only HTML and CSS. Designed with a minimalistic black-and-white theme.

## Overview

This was a small exercise for me to develop a clean website with a good design using only HTML and CSS.. I will add responsiveness to this portfolio soon.

## Project Purpose

The key objectives of this project include:
- Exploring the potential of HTML and CSS.
- Enjoying the process of bringing a concept to life through coding and design.
- Providing a resource for others interested in learning how to build beautiful websites with minimal resources.

## Features

- **Minimalistic Design**: The site features a black-and-white theme that highlights the beauty of simplicity.
- **Clean Navigation**: The straightforward navigation makes it easy to browse through the portfolio.
- **Pure CSS Styling**: Every element on the page is styled exclusively with CSS, proving that sometimes less is more.

## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I aimed to:
- Deepen my understanding of the foundational web technologiesâ€”HTML and CSS.
- Experiment with different design ideas in a fun and engaging way.
- Create a resource that others can use to learn and draw inspiration from.
